# Cause Finder – Stateful LSTM Text Classification

This project demonstrates a stateful LSTM model using Keras and GloVe embeddings for sentiment analysis or text classification tasks. It includes preprocessing, visualization, model training, and saving model state across batches.

## Features
- Text preprocessing with NLTK
- GloVe word embeddings
- Stateful LSTM architecture
- Dropout regularization
- Training visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- WordCloud for insight on tokens

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for full details.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cause-finder.git
cd cause-finder
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook lstm_with_save_cells.ipynb
```

## Notes
- This project was originally developed in Google Colab.
- Ensure the GloVe embeddings file is available or update the path in the notebook.
